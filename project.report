2. Introduction
In today’s digital world, strong passwords are essential to protect personal and professional data. However, many people still use weak passwords that are easy to guess or crack.
This project, Password Generator Using Python, is a desktop-based application developed using the Tkinter library. It helps users generate strong, random, and secure passwords instantly using a simple and user-friendly graphical interface.
The main aim of this project is to make secure password creation easy and accessible for everyone, even non-technical users.

3. Problem Statement
Many users:
•	Use weak passwords (like names, birthdates, “123456”, etc.)
•	Reuse passwords for multiple accounts
•	Don’t know how to create strong passwords
This makes them vulnerable to hacking, brute-force attacks, and data theft.
Problem:
How to provide users with an easy-to-use application to generate strong random passwords without manual effort?
Solution:
A GUI-based Python application that automatically generates secure and random passwords based on user-selected length.
________________________________________
4. Functional Requirements
The system should be able to:
1.	Allow the user to select the password length.
2.	Generate a random and secure password.
3.	Display the generated password on screen.
4.	Allow the user to copy the password to clipboard.
5.	Generate multiple passwords at once (5 or 10).
6.	Display multiple passwords in a separate text area.
7.	Show messages like “Password Copied” for user feedback.

5. Non-Functional Requirements
1.	Usability:
Easy for anyone to use without technical knowledge.
2.	Performance:
Password generation should be fast and instantaneous.
3.	Portability:
Should run on Windows, Linux, and macOS.
4.	Security:
The app should not store passwords permanently.
5.	Reliability:
The program should not crash during normal operations.

6. System Architecture
The architecture of the system is simple and standalone:
User → Tkinter GUI → Password Generator Logic → Display Result
Main Components:
•	User Interface (Tkinter)
•	Password Generation Logic
•	Clipboard Module
•	Display Module

8. Design Decisions & Rationale
1.	Chose Tkinter because it is built into Python and lightweight.
2.	Used random and string modules to generate secure passwords.
3.	Did not use database/storage to protect user privacy.
4.	Chose a dark UI theme to reduce eye strain and look modern.
________________________________________
9. Implementation Details
Programming Language: Python
Library Used: Tkinter (GUI)
Supporting Libraries:
•	random
•	string
The password is generated using:
string.ascii_letters + string.digits + "!@#$%^&*"
Each button in the GUI is connected to a function such as:
•	generate_password()
•	generate_multiple()
•	copy_password()

11. Testing Approach
Types of Testing Performed:
•	Functional Testing
•	Manual Testing
•	User Interface Testing
Sample Test Cases:
Test Case	Input	Expected Result	Status
Generate Password	Length = 12	12-character password	Pass
Copy Button	Click Copy	Password copied	Pass
Generate Multiple	Click 10	10 passwords displayed	Pass

12. Challenges Faced
1.	Styling the Tkinter GUI to look modern.
2.	Handling alignment and layout issues.
3.	Clipboard operations across different systems.
4.	Understanding event-driven programming in Tkinter.

13. Learnings & Key Takeaways
Through this project, I learned:
•	How to build desktop GUI applications using Tkinter.
•	How to apply randomization and logic in Python.
•	GUI layout management and event handling.
•	Importance of user-friendly design.

14. Future Enhancements
If this project is extended further, the following features can be added:
1.	Password strength meter
2.	Options to include/exclude symbols or numbers
3.	Save generated passwords to a file
4.	Theme switcher (Light/Dark mode)
5.	Password history section
